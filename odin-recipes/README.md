# odin-recipes
This is my first project on the odin project. In this I'll be practicing the basics of creating recipe webpage from scratch. Along with this I'll be practicing using git commands in terminal. There will be a total of 4 pages- home(index), vegan alfredo (recipe 1), 40-minute Pho (recipe 2), edible cookie doughcd odi-- and (recipe 3).

recipe page content:
    1. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on google or the site recipe site we linked to earlier.
    2. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
    3. Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
    4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.
