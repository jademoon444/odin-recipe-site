        <h3>Steps to make this meal</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add pasta to a large pot of boiling, well-salted water and cook according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>While waiting to for the water to boil and pasta to cook, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and garlic, stirring quickly to ensure it doesn’t burn</li>
            <li>Reduce heat slightly, gradually add all-purpose flour and whisk to combine. Cook for about a minute and then add almond milk slowly (about 1/4 cup at a time) as you're whisking to prevent clumps. Cook for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Next, add your seasonings, vegan parmesan cheese, nutritional yeast, and whisk throughly until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed – don't be shy.</li>
            <li>If sauce is too thick, add a little more milk. If too thin, whisk in 1-2 tsp more of all-purpose flour. Whisk to combine and repeat as needed. <B>Once the desired consistency is reached, add your broccoli and allow the sauce to simmer.</B></li>
            <li>Once sauce is ready, add pasta, plant-based chicken, and toss. Cook for 1-2 minutes to warm through then serve with fresh basil, additional vegan parmesan cheese, and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator for up to a few days, though best when fresh.</li>
        </ol>
